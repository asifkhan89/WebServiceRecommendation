The main goal of this Web service QoS dataset is to offer real-world data for Web Service researchers. 

The dataset contains 4 files, where "userlist.txt" and "wslist.txt" introudce 339 users and 5825 reall-world Web services of the dataset, respectively; "rtmatrix.txt" and "tpmatrix.txt" are the response-time and throughput QoS values, respectively.

This dataset includes the following files: 

userlist.txt:  19KB
	totally 339 service users. 
	| User ID | IP address of user | country | longitude | latitude |


wslist.txt: 505KB
	totally 5825 Web services. 
	| WS ID | WSDL address | provider name | country name |

rtmatrix.txt: 11MB
	339 * 5825 user-item matrix for response-time. 
	

tpmatrix.txt: 12MB
	339 * 5825 user-item matrix for throughput.

It is better to use UltraEdit to open the rtmatrix.txt and tpmatrix.txt files, since the file sizes are too large for Notepad.
